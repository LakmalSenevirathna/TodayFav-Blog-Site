            <p>Right whales play a number of important ecological roles in the ocean. They help keep the marine ecosystem
                healthy and productive by redistributing nutrients across the ocean through their fecal matter. After they
                die, their carcasses sink to the bottom of the ocean where they serve as food for other organisms.
                While critically important to the ocean’s health, the number of North Atlantic right whales is dwindling
                to dire levels. With less than 100 breeding females left, the number of calves being born each year cannot
                keep pace with the number of human-caused deaths.
                Right whales communicate with one another through vocal calls, which can be heard over distances of more
                than 20 miles. The calls let whales stay in touch, share information about food, help mates find each
                other, and keep groups together while traveling. However, rising levels of ocean noise are interfering
                with their ability to communicate.</p>
